### Dev Note: Emulate Print Media ###

In order to print a year calendar, it seems every year Chrome has slightly changed the way the printed calendar renders.
Now in the Dev Tools, you can use: Ctrl+Shift+P, then type `Rendering`, to show a rendering drawer in the dev tools.
The rendering drawer can be used to set which print media (screen, or print) should be used to emulate to help
testing of the printed page.
